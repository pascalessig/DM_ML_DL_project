This was the final group project in the second semester from the Data Mining, Machine Learning, Deep Learning course.

Project description:
Credit card fraud causes serious economic damage and destabilizes the trust in industries. Due to the complexity of the problem, identifying fraudulent transactions based on manual techniques has shown to be ineffective and inefficient. In this paper, different supervised machine learning based approaches are tested in order to identify a high number of fraudulent credit card transactions. The goal is to contain criminal action and to provide an economically viable solution to financial institutions. The research was conducted based on a dataset with credit card transactions from European cardholders, where different sampling methods (SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN) are applied to handle the imbalance of the data. Subsequently, a Random Forest, a Logistic Regression, SVM, and an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) are developed. The work shows that all model types are able to prevent fraudulent transactions to some degree and contribute to contain criminal action. However, only the Random Forest model in combination with Borderline-SMOTE and the SVM model with SMOTE produces economically feasible results that could be implemented by a financial institution.
